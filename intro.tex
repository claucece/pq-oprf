\section{Introduction}%
\label{sec:introduction}

Lattice-based cryptography uses as a fundamental hardness assumption the fact that it is computationally difficult to find a low-norm vector s satisfying:

A basic construction could be an emulation of the blinding construction $H(x)^{k} = (H(x) ^{r})^{k}) ^ {1/r}$.
The steps are:

\begin{itemize}
  \item The server publishes some commitment to a small key $k \in R_q$.
  \item On client's input $x$, the client picks \emph{invertible} $s \in R_q$, small $e \in R^{1 \times l}_q$ and sends $c_x = a_x \cdot s + e$.
  \item On server's $k \in R_q$, the server sends $d_x = c_x \cdot k + e^{\prime}$ for small $e^{\prime} \in R^{1 \times l}_q$.
  \item The client outputs $y = \lceil {p \over q} \cdot d_x \cdot s^{-1} \rceil$
\end{itemize}

Requirement:

\begin{itemize}
  \item the set should be large (around $2^{256}$),
  \item the elements in it should have small norms,
  \item the non-zero element $s \in R_q$ must be invertible.
  \item inverted elements should have small coefficients.
\end{itemize}

All non-zero polynomials with ``small'' coefficients in the cyclotomic ring $Z_p[X]/(\phi_m(X))$ are invertible (where ``small'' depends on the size of $p$ and how many irreducible factors the $m^{th}$ cyclotomic polynomial $\phi_m(X)$ splits into).


\section{Verifiability}

This property can be realized by letting the client obtain a commitment to the PRF key `k`, and requiring the server to provide zero-knowledge proofs of correct evaluation w.r.t. k.
The commitment should exist in respect to `x` and `s, e` from the client.
I think it is clear we could use the the ABDLOP Commitment Scheme.
